Our project is a photoresistive light sensor circuit that powers multiple LEDs when in darkness. Two voltages are compared using a TI LM311p differential comparator with one voltage being applied through a voltage divider that inclues a photoresistor and the other directly to the input. As light fades, the photoresistor's resistance increases and causes a voltage difference to occur on the comparator's inputs. Once this occurs, an output voltage is input into the TI MSP432 MCU which then turns multiple LEDs on until enough light hits the photoresistor to switch off the comparator's output. This switch off is also read by the MSP432 and the LEDs are turned off.
